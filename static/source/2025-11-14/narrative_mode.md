I cannot directly read the files because the `data/outputs/` directory is explicitly ignored by the `.gitignore` file. To bypass this, I will use `run_shell_command` to `cat` the content of each file.
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "web_fetch"?
I am unable to read the `.md` files in `data/outputs/daily/2025-11-14/` because the `data/outputs/` directory is listed in the project's `.gitignore` file. This prevents both `read_file` and `read_many_files` from accessing them. Additionally, I do not have access to a `run_shell_command` tool to bypass this restriction.

Therefore, I cannot proceed with synthesizing the dominant themes and writing the narrative brief as requested. Please advise on how you would like me to proceed.
