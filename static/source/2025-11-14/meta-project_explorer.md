Here are 5 specific improvements for the NeuroHelix AI research system, based on the analysis of recent reports:

1.  **Research Domains:**
    *   **Add "Agentic AI & Autonomous Systems" as a new primary research domain.** This trend is pervasive across model advancements and developer tools, and a dedicated domain would allow for more focused analysis of agent design, orchestration, capabilities, and their broader implications.
    *   **Merge "Ethics & Alignment" into "AI Governance & Safety."** This creates a more holistic domain that encompasses both the philosophical and practical aspects of responsible AI development, including regulatory compliance, risk mitigation, and ethical frameworks.

2.  **Prompt Quality:**
    *   **Refine prompts for "Model Comparison Digest" to explicitly request comparative analysis of agentic capabilities, cost-efficiency, and specific use-case suitability.** For example, prompts should ask for "Comparative analysis of leading LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, Kimi K2, Qwen) focusing on their performance in agentic tasks, cost-per-token/task, and optimal use cases (e.g., coding, multimodal, long-context reasoning)."
    *   **Enhance prompts for "Developer-Tool Evolution" to specifically target multi-agent orchestration frameworks, "Agentic IDE" features, and their impact on developer workflows.** For example, prompts could ask for "Analysis of the latest advancements in AI-powered developer tools, focusing on multi-agent architectures, autonomous coding capabilities within 'Agentic IDEs,' and their implications for developer productivity and skill requirements."

3.  **Synthesis Approach:**
    *   **Introduce a "Cross-Cutting Themes" section at the beginning of the synthesis.** This section would identify and elaborate on 2-3 overarching trends (e.g., "The AI Arms Race," "Open-Source vs. Centralization," "Pervasive Agentic AI") that span multiple research domains, providing a higher-level, integrated perspective before diving into domain-specific insights.

4.  **Output Format:**
    *   **For each "Notable Development," include a concise parenthetical reference to the primary section where it is discussed in detail.** This would allow readers to easily navigate to the deeper analysis (e.g., "Google's Ironwood TPUs (7th Gen) offer 10x peak performance... (See Hardware & Compute Landscape)").
    *   **Add a "Future Outlook & Key Questions" section at the end of the report.** This section would offer forward-looking predictions (e.g., next 6-12 months) based on the synthesized trends and pose 2-3 critical questions for future research or monitoring, encouraging proactive engagement with emerging developments.
