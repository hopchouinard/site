# Prompt-Engineering Trends - 2025-11-14

Loaded cached credentials.
Here's a summary of new prompt-engineering techniques and frameworks discussed by leading practitioners online in 2025:

**New Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

*   **Combined Prompt Types:** Blending various prompt styles (few-shot, role-based, formatting, chain-of-thought) for complex tasks.
*   **Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting (RSIP):** AI models critiquing and enhancing their own outputs.
*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Variations:** Including Chain-of-Thought Factored Decomposition Prompting, and Multimodal and Multi-Agent Chain-of-Thought for diverse data and LLM communication.
*   **Agentic AI Prompting:** Leveraging generative AI for end-to-end tasks.
*   **Large Concept Model (LCM) Prompting:** An emerging technique focusing on "concepts" rather than just words.
*   **Prompt Compression:** Reducing prompt length while maintaining effectiveness for token optimization.
*   **Context Engineering:** Designing and managing all elements accompanying user prompts (system instructions, retrieved knowledge, tool definitions).
*   **Automatic Prompt Optimization:** Techniques like MiPRO and GEPA that automatically refine prompts using test datasets.

**Prompt Engineering Frameworks:**

*   **CRISPE:** (Context – Role – Input – Steps – Parameters – Example) for multi-step tasks with strict constraints.
*   **APE (Ask–Plan–Execute):** Guides the model to understand, plan, and then execute for problem-solving.
*   **ROLE:** Sets the model's specific role, objectives, limitations, and evaluation criteria.
*   **Self-Consistency / SxS (Side-by-Side):** Generates multiple solutions, compares them, and selects the best.
*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought:** Fundamental for complex reasoning and analysis.
*   **DSPy:** An open-source framework for automatic prompt optimization.

**Leading Practitioners and Tools:**

*   **Leading Practitioners:** Sander Schulhoff ("OG prompt engineer"), Mike Taylor (co-author of "Prompt Engineering for Generative AI"), and experts from Anthropic and Google Research.
*   **Key Tools:** IBM Watsonx Prompt Lab, Spellbook, Dust, OpenAI Playground, Databutton, PromptTools (for development); LangSmith, Flowise, CrewAI, DSPy (for frameworks/orchestration); Prompt Perfect, AI PRM for ChatGPT, PromptLayer, Vellum, PromptOps, PromptFlow (for optimization/management); Maxim AI, AgentMark, MuseBox.io, Secondisc (for evaluation).
