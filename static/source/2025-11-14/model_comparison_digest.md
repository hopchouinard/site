Here's a summary of benchmark results and performance discussions for major AI models (Gemini, GPT, Claude, Mistral) published in the last week (late 2024 and November 2025):

**Overall Performance and Key Strengths:**

*   **GPT (OpenAI):** GPT-5 and GPT-5.1 lead in general intelligence, reasoning (GPQA Diamond: 88.1% for GPT-5.1), and agentic coding (SWE Bench: 76.3% for GPT-5.1). GPT-4o is strong in multimodal capabilities.
*   **Gemini (Google):** Gemini 2.5 Pro shows strong reasoning (GPQA Diamond: 86.4%) and excels in math and vision. It boasts a massive context window (over 1 million tokens). Gemini-Exp-1114 topped the Imarena Chatbot Arena leaderboard in November 2024.
*   **Claude (Anthropic):** Claude Opus 4.1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet are strong in complex reasoning and coding (Opus 4.1 SWE Bench: 74.5%; Claude 3.5 Sonnet coding accuracy: 93.7%). They are noted for human-like writing and explanatory abilities.
*   **Mistral (Mistral AI):** Mistral Large 2 (July 2024) offers a balance of performance, multilingual support, and affordability (MMLU: 84.0%, HumanEval: 92%). Mistral Medium 3 (May 2025) rivals top models in coding and is cost-effective.

**Specific Benchmark Highlights:**

*   **Reasoning (GPQA Diamond):** GPT 5.1 (88.1%), Grok 4 (87.5%), GPT-5 (87.3%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (86.4%).
*   **High School Math (AIME 2025):** GPT-5 (100%), Kimi K2 Thinking (99.1%).
*   **Agentic Coding (SWE Bench):** GPT 5.1 (76.3%), Grok 4 (75%), GPT-5 (74.9%), Claude Opus 4.1 (74.5%), Claude Haiku 4.5 (73.3%). Gemini 2.5 Pro is noted to be behind Claude 3.7 and GPT-5 on SWE-bench Verified.
*   **Coding Accuracy:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (93.7%) outperformed GPT-4o (90.2%) and Gemini (71.9%) in one comparison.
*   **Multilingual and Coding:** Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 2.5-Coder are highlighted for multilingual support (29 languages) and strong coding performance, outperforming GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 in coding tasks.

**Context Window Capacity:**

*   Gemini 2.5 Pro: Over 1 million tokens.
*   Claude 3.7 Sonnet: 200,000 tokens.
*   GPT-4o and Mistral Small 3.1: 128,000 tokens.

**Cost Efficiency:**

*   Mistral Small 3.1 is considered the most budget-friendly.
*   Mistral Medium 3 offers competitive performance at a lower cost.
*   GPT-4o balances cost and functionality.
*   Claude 3.7 Sonnet has higher costs, justified by its advanced reasoning.

It's important to note that benchmarks evolve rapidly, and some may become saturated as models improve.
