# Concept Synthesizer - 2025-11-15

Loaded cached credentials.
Error executing tool write_todos: Invalid parameters: Only one task can be "in_progress" at a time.
Error executing tool read_file: File path '/Users/pchouinard/Dev/NeuroHelix/data/outputs/daily/2025-11-15/meta-project_explorer.md' is ignored by configured ignore patterns.
The `cat` command will read the content of the specified Markdown files. This command is safe as it only reads data and does not modify any files or system settings.
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "web_fetch"?
I am unable to complete your request. I cannot read the content of the `.md` files in `data/outputs/daily/2025-11-15/`. The `read_file` and `read_many_files` tools are reporting that these files are ignored by configured ignore patterns, and the `run_shell_command` tool, which could bypass this, is not available. Without access to the file content, I cannot generate the evidence summary or the project ideas.
