Here's a summary of new prompt-engineering techniques and frameworks discussed by leading practitioners online in 2024-2025:

**New Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

*   **Context Engineering:** Focuses on optimizing the entire context window provided to an AI model, rather than just the prompt instructions.
*   **Output Formatting Instructions:** Emphasizes using specific formats like XML, JSON, or Markdown to guide the AI for consistent and improved results.
*   **Chain-of-Table:** A technique showing substantial improvements for structured data analysis.
*   **AI Self-Improvement of Prompts:** Leverages AI models to optimize their own prompts, with research indicating AI can generate better prompts faster than human experts.
*   **Multimodal Integration:** Allows prompts to seamlessly combine text with images, audio, and video inputs.
*   **Dynamic Context Management:** Enables advanced prompting systems to maintain context across extended conversations and adapt based on user feedback.
*   **Automated Prompt Optimization:** Utilizes machine learning systems to optimize prompts, creating recursive improvement loops.
*   **Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting (RSIP):** Involves AI critiquing and enhancing its own output through systematic generation and evaluation.
*   **Layered Prompting:** Combines role framing, structured reasoning, and format constraints into a single instruction set.
*   **Combining Prompt Types:** Blends various prompt styles (e.g., few-shot examples, role-based instructions, chain-of-thought) for complex tasks.
*   **Adaptive & Personalized Prompts:** AI models adjust responses based on user behavior, input style, and preferences.
*   **Generative AI-Assisted Prompt Creation & Real-Time Prompt Optimization:** AI tools suggest, optimize, and provide instant feedback on prompt clarity.
*   Foundational techniques like Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Role-Based, and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning remain essential.

**Prompt Engineering Frameworks:**

*   **Structured Methodologies:** Define key elements such as context, objective, style and tone, constraints, and output format.
*   **TCRTE framework:** (Task clarity, Context, References, Testing criteria, Enhancement strategies) is recognized as a standard practice.
*   **LangChain:** A prominent open-source framework for building language model-powered applications, enabling chaining of multiple prompts.
*   **PromptPerfect:** A tool designed for refining and optimizing prompts with cross-model support and AI-assisted refinement.
*   **Stanford's HELM project:** Provides resources for evaluating the reasoning and performance differences between leading LLMs.
*   **Industry-Specific Frameworks:** Specialized methodologies tailored for different sectors are emerging.

**Leading Practitioners:**

*   **Sander Schulhoff:** Credited with creating the first prompt engineering guide and co-authoring a comprehensive study.
*   **Karpathy:** Advocates for "context engineering."
*   **Miqdad Jaffer (OpenAI) and Aakash Gupta:** Co-authored an article on "Prompt Engineering in 2025: The Latest Best Practices."
