Here's a summary of recent benchmark results and performance discussions for major AI models (Gemini, GPT, Claude, Mistral) from the last week:

**Top Performers:**
*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Consistently ranks high, often at the top, in recent leaderboards for reasoning (GPQA Diamond) and general text performance (LMArena). It also shows strong results in offline IQ tests and math/science assessments.
*   **GPT Models (GPT 5.1, GPT-5, GPT-4.5):** Demonstrate strong performance across various benchmarks, leading in reasoning (GPQA Diamond) and agentic coding (SWE Bench).
*   **Claude Models (Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Claude Opus 4.1):** Highly competitive, securing top positions in text performance (LMArena) and strong scores in agentic coding (SWE Bench).

**Key Highlights:**
*   **Reasoning (GPQA Diamond):** GPT 5.1, Grok 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro are leading.
*   **Agentic Coding (SWE Bench):** GPT 5.1, Grok 4, GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Claude Haiku 4.5 are top performers.
*   **Text Performance (LMArena):** Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Claude Opus 4.1 are the top three.
*   **Mistral Models (Mistral Medium 3):** Noted for cost-efficiency and strong performance in specific domains, particularly coding and business applications, often rivaling Claude 3.7 and Gemini 2.0.
*   **Context Window:** Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sep/May) offers the largest context windows at 2 million tokens, with Gemini 2.5 Pro also having a massive context window. Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o/Mistral Small 3.1 also offer substantial context capacities.

**Note on Dates:** Some sources mention future dates (e.g., 2025-05-08), which might refer to projected benchmarks or future model releases. However, leaderboards from Vellum AI and LMArena, updated on November 13, 2025, and "5 days ago" respectively, provide the most current data.
