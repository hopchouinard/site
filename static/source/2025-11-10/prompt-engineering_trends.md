Here are some new prompt-engineering techniques and frameworks discussed by leading practitioners online:

**New Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

*   **Advanced Reasoning:**
    *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Breaking down complex problems into sequential, intermediate steps.
    *   **Tree of Thoughts (ToT):** Exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously for complex problem-solving.
    *   **Self-consistency Prompting:** Generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer.
    *   **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting):** Combining reasoning with specific actions in a loop of thought, action, observation, and reflection.
    *   **Least-to-Most Prompting (LtM):** Decomposing tasks into smaller sub-problems.
    *   **Program-Aided Language Models (PAL):** Integrating external programming environments to solve tasks.
    *   **Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) Prompting:** Verifying information generated by LLMs.
*   **Context and Role-based:**
    *   **Meta Prompting:** Structuring and guiding LLM responses by outlining steps or logic.
    *   **Role Prompting:** Assigning the LLM a specific role or persona.
    *   **Multi-Task Prompting:** Designing a single prompt to perform multiple interconnected tasks.
    *   **Context Engineering:** Designing, curating, and governing non-prompt elements like system instructions and retrieved knowledge.
    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Retrieving information from external knowledge bases for more informed responses.
*   **Output Generation & Refinement:**
    *   **Zero-shot Prompting:** Instructing an LLM without providing examples.
    *   **Few-shot Prompting:** Including a few examples of desired input-output pairs.
    *   **Verbalized Sampling (VS):** Generating multiple answers based on internal probability distribution to mitigate "mode collapse."

**Prompt Engineering Frameworks:**

*   **Structured Prompting:**
    *   **CRISPE Framework:** (Context, Role, Instructions, Steps, Persona, Examples) for complex tasks.
    *   **COSTAR Framework:** (Context, Objective, Style and tone, Constraints, Format).
    *   **CRAFT Framework:** (Context, Role, Action, Focus, Format) for well-defined prompts.
*   **Research & Inquiry:**
    *   **CLEAR Framework:** (Context, Logic, Expectations, Action, Results) for structured research queries.
    *   **QUEST Framework:** (Question, Understanding, Expectation, Scope, Time) for refining research questions.
    *   **GUIDE Framework:** (Goal, Understanding, Information, Direction, Evaluation) for systematic research.
    *   **RHODES Framework:** (Research, Hypothesis, Objectives, Development, Evaluation, Synthesis) for hypothesis-driven research.
*   **Scenario & Task-based:**
    *   **STAR Framework:** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for scenario-based prompting.
    *   **RTF Framework:** (Role, Task, Format) for quick, focused tasks.
    *   **5W1H Framework:** (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) for comprehensive information gathering.
    *   **REACT Framework:** (Reason, Execute, Analyze, Critique, Try again) for iterative problem-solving.
    *   **DARE Framework:** For systematically refining prompts based on results.

**Leading Practitioners:**

While specific individual practitioners are often found within academic research, the field also recognizes contributions from:

*   **AI Prompt Engineering Companies:** Firms specializing in AI solutions and prompt optimization, such as SolGuruz, Data Robot, HatchWorks AI, Netguru, Black Widow Tech, BlueLabel, and Neoteric.
*   **Authors and Researchers:** Individuals like Mike Taylor (co-author of "Prompt Engineering for Generative AI") and Dr. Lance B. Eliot (AI scientist and consultant).
*   **Online Communities:** Platforms like Reddit's r/ChatGPTPromptGenius and r/PromptEngineering, where experienced individuals share insights.
