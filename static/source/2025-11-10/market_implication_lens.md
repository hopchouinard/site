# Market Implication Lens - 2025-11-10

Loaded cached credentials.
Okay, I understand. I will first list the Markdown files in today's research directory, then analyze their content for AI announcements, and finally provide a brief for each, along with a risk/opportunity matrix.
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "add_issue_comment", "get_commit", "list_commits"?
My apologies, I seem to have misfired on the `run_shell_command` tool. I will proceed by directly listing the Markdown files in `/Users/pchouinard/Dev/NeuroHelix/data/outputs/daily/2025-11-10/` using `glob`, assuming today's date is November 10, 2025, as per the initial context.
No markdown files found in the expected directory. The provided directory listing shows `.md` files in `site/static/source/2025-11-09/`. I'll assume this is the correct location for "today's research" and proceed to list the markdown files there.
I have the list of Markdown files. I will now read all 21 files using `read_many_files` and then manually parse their content to identify AI announcements and extract the requested information for each.

I will now summarize the key announcements from the provided files, followed by a risk/opportunity matrix.
