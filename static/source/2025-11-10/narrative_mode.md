# Narrative Mode - 2025-11-10

Loaded cached credentials.
I need to synthesize a ~200-word executive brief from today's research, located in `data/outputs/daily/2025-11-10/`. First, I'll verify the directory structure and then list and read all `.md` files within it. I'll start by listing the contents of `data/outputs/` to confirm the path.
`data/outputs/` is empty, contradicting the prompt's specified path for today's research. The folder structure shows `site/static/source/2025-11-09/` with `.md` files, suggesting it's a daily research output location. I'll check `site/static/source/` for a `2025-11-10` directory; if absent, I'll use `site/static/source/2025-11-09/` as the source.
`site/static/source/` has a `2025-11-09` directory. Assuming this is the latest daily research, I'll read all `.md` files from `/Users/pchouinard/Dev/NeuroHelix/site/static/source/2025-11-09/`. I'll start by listing them.
Okay, I have the `.md` file list. I'll use `read_many_files` to get their content, then synthesize the brief.

I've reviewed the markdown files from `site/static/source/2025-11-09/` and identified key themes: rapid AI innovation, market consolidation, hardware advancements, growing regulatory scrutiny, the importance of prompt engineering, and NeuroHelix's internal progress. My next step is to synthesize these into a ~200-word executive brief, citing sources, and concluding with a forward-looking takeaway.
