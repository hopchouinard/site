# Narrative Mode - 2025-11-11

Loaded cached credentials.
I need to access the research files for today's date, November 11, 2025. However, the directory `data/outputs/daily/2025-11-11/` does not appear in the provided folder structure.

Could you please confirm the correct path for today's research files? If the directory `data/outputs/daily/2025-11-11/` is indeed the correct one, I will proceed to check if it exists and then read the files. If it doesn't exist, I'll need an alternative path.
The previous `list_directory` command indicated some ignored files, but didn't confirm the presence of `.md` files. I'll use `glob` to specifically check for markdown files in `/Users/pchouinard/Dev/NeuroHelix/data/outputs/daily/2025-11-11/` to ensure I'm looking in the right place.
It appears there are no markdown files in the specified directory for today's date (`/Users/pchouinard/Dev/NeuroHelix/data/outputs/daily/2025-11-11/`).

Could you please confirm the correct directory where "Today's completed research" markdown files are located for November 11, 2025? The provided folder structure shows `site/static/source/2025-11-09/` and `site/static/source/2025-11-10/` as potential locations for daily research. Which date should I use?
