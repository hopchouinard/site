Here's a summary of new prompt-engineering techniques and frameworks, along with some leading practitioners:

**New Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

*   **Zero-shot prompting:** Giving an LLM an instruction without any prior examples.
*   **Few-shot prompting:** Including examples within the prompt to help the LLM understand the task better.
*   **Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller, sequential steps to improve reasoning.
*   **Meta prompting:** Using an LLM to generate or refine prompts for other LLMs or itself.
*   **Self-consistency prompting:** Aiming for more reliable outputs.
*   **Hermeneutic prompting:** Encouraging recursive, cyclical analysis of a question for comprehensive answers.
*   **Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting:** Guiding LLMs to decompose tasks into smaller sub-problems.
*   **Multi-Task Prompting:** Designing a single prompt to handle several interconnected actions simultaneously.
*   **Role Prompting (Persona Prompting):** Assigning a specific role or persona to the LLM to guide its style and focus.
*   **Program-Aided Language Models (PAL) and Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) Prompting:** Next-generation techniques for improved performance and verification.
*   **Prompt Folding & Dynamic Generation:** Allowing prompts to dynamically create more specialized sub-prompts based on context.
*   **Hyper-Specific & Detailed (The "Manager" Approach):** Providing extensive, detailed instructions to the LLM.
*   **Structuring Prompts and Expected Output:** Using formatting like Markdown or XML-like tags to define instructions and output formats.

**Prompt Engineering Frameworks:**

*   **COSTAR:** Context, Objective, Style and tone, Constraints, and Format.
*   **CRISPE:** Suitable for large-scale enterprise systems.
*   **RACE:** Role, Action, Context, and Examples.
*   **CLEAR:** Context, Logic, Expectations, Action, and Restrictions for structured research queries.
*   **SMART:** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) adapted for prompt engineering.
*   **CRAFT:** Role, Action, and Focus to create adaptable prompts.
*   **SPEAR:** (Start, Provide, Explain, Ask, Rinse & Repeat) developed by Britney Muller.
*   **RASCEF:** (Role, Action, Steps, Context, Examples, Format) a comprehensive template.
*   Other frameworks include Before-After-Bridge (BAB), Tree of Thought (ToT), Five S model, Agile prompt engineering, QUEST, GUIDE, FOCUS, IDEA, RISEN, and CREATE.

**Leading Practitioners:**

*   **Britney Muller:** Developed the SPEAR Framework.
*   **Mike Taylor:** Co-author of "Prompt Engineering for Generative AI."
*   **Lance Eliot:** Forbes contributor and AI scientist.
*   **George Hotz:** Listed among prompt engineer influencers.
*   Instructors like **Saad A., Steve Ballinger, and Chetan Pujari** are prominent in online education platforms.

Companies like Prompts.ai, Krazimo Private Limited, STS Software, OpenXcell, Vsynergize, and Bacancy Technology also offer specialized AI prompt engineering services.
