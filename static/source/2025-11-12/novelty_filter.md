# Novelty Filter - 2025-11-12

Loaded cached credentials.
I understand the issue. I will first read the `.gitignore` file to confirm the exclusion of `data/outputs/`. Then, I will propose a solution based on your previous options.
The `.gitignore` file confirms that `data/outputs/` (and indeed the entire `data/` directory) is ignored, which is why I cannot access the files.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed:
1.  **Temporarily modify `.gitignore`**: I can temporarily remove `data/outputs/` from `.gitignore` to access the files, and then revert the change.
2.  **Manually provide content**: You can manually copy and paste the content of `data/outputs/daily/2025-11-11/concept_synthesizer.md` here.
3.  **Alternative location**: Are the research findings available in a different, non-ignored directory?
