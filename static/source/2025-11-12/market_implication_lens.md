# Market Implication Lens - 2025-11-12

Loaded cached credentials.
Okay, I understand. I will analyze the AI research for today, November 12, 2025, from the specified directory.

First, I need to list the Markdown files in `/Users/pchouinard/Dev/NeuroHelix/data/outputs/daily/2025-11-12/`.
It appears the directory `/Users/pchouinard/Dev/NeuroHelix/data/outputs/daily/2025-11-12/` is empty or does not exist as expected.

Based on the provided folder structure, it seems more likely that the daily research Markdown files are located in `site/static/source/2025-11-12/`. I will proceed by checking that directory instead.
Error executing tool list_directory: Error listing directory: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/Users/pchouinard/Dev/NeuroHelix/site/static/source/2025-11-12/'
It appears there's no research data available for November 12, 2025, in the expected directories. The provided folder structure only shows data up to November 11, 2025.

Could you please clarify where "Today's research" (for November 12, 2025) is located, or if I should analyze the data from a different date, such as November 11, 2025?
