Here's a summary of benchmark results and performance discussions for major AI models (Gemini, GPT, Claude, Mistral, etc.) published in the last week (late October and early November 2025):

**Overall Performance and Reasoning:**
*   **Grok 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro** lead in Reasoning (GPQA Diamond benchmark).
*   **GPT-5** achieved 100% in High School Math (AIME 2025), with Claude Haiku 4.5 also performing strongly.
*   **Gemini 2.5** surpassed OpenAI's o3 mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet in the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE).

**Coding and Agentic Capabilities:**
*   **Grok 4, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.1** are top performers in Agentic Coding (SWE Bench).
*   **Claude Sonnet 4.5** achieved state-of-the-art performance in SWE-Bench Verified.
*   **Mistral Medium 3** has been noted to outperform GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet in coding tasks, often at a lower cost.

**Speed and Latency:**
*   **Mixtral (Mistral 8x7B)** emerged as the fastest in raw API response speed.
*   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** demonstrated consistently low latency and high-quality output among proprietary models.
*   **GPT-4 Turbo** is considered reliable but slower than some competitors.
*   **Gemini 1.5** exhibited the slowest response times, especially for longer completions.

**Context Window and Other Strengths:**
*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro** stands out with a substantial context window of over 1 million tokens.
*   **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** offers a 200,000-token capacity, with Enterprise plans extending to 500,000 tokens.
*   **GPT-4o and Mistral Small 3.1** both support 128,000 tokens.
*   **Claude** is often highlighted for its human-sounding writing tone and ability to explain complex topics.
*   **GPT-4o and Mistral** have shown strong performance in proofreading.
*   **Mistral models** are recognized for their cost-efficiency and flexibility, with Mistral Large 2 offering strong reasoning and Codestral specializing in code.
