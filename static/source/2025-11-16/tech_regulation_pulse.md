No new AI laws or significant regulatory updates were reported in North America in the last 7 days. However, ongoing legislative efforts and recently enacted laws (earlier in 2024 and 2025) in the US, Canada, and Mexico indicate a growing focus on AI regulation.

In the European Union, significant developments occurred in the last 7 days regarding the EU's AI Act. The European Commission is preparing to unveil reforms as part of a "Digital Omnibus" package around November 19th. Key proposals include potential delays (up to one year) in the implementation of certain provisions of the AI Act, possibly pushing rules for high-risk AI systems to 2027. There are also proposed overhauls of data protection rules, potentially narrowing the definition of personal data and allowing companies to process such data for AI training under "legitimate interest," and the removal of website cookie consent banners. These revisions are influenced by lobbying from industry, but face strong opposition from privacy advocates.

**Potential Business Impacts:**

**North America:**
*   **Increased Compliance Burden (US States):** Businesses operating in states like California, Colorado, and Utah will need to comply with specific AI transparency, algorithmic discrimination, and generative AI disclosure requirements, leading to increased legal and operational costs.
*   **Intellectual Property Concerns (Mexico, US):** Businesses using generative AI for media creation need to ensure proper licensing and consent due to focus on preventing unauthorized voice cloning and protecting creative rights.
*   **Uncertainty in Canada:** The lack of a comprehensive federal AI law creates regulatory uncertainty, requiring businesses to monitor provincial developments.

**European Union:**
*   **Delayed Compliance for AI Act:** Potential delays in the AI Act's implementation could provide businesses more time to prepare for compliance, reducing immediate pressure and costs.
*   **Data Processing Flexibility:** Changes to data protection rules could ease the burden on businesses developing AI models by simplifying data acquisition and usage for training.
*   **Reduced User Friction:** Removal of cookie banners could improve user experience and engagement for online businesses.
*   **Reputational Risks:** Businesses benefiting from rollbacks in data protection might face public backlash.
*   **Continued Uncertainty:** The ongoing debate means the final form of the AI Act is still uncertain, requiring businesses to closely monitor developments.
