# Prompt-Engineering Trends - 2025-11-16

Loaded cached credentials.
Here's a summary of new prompt-engineering techniques and frameworks discussed by leading practitioners online between 2023 and 2025:

**New Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

*   **Combining Prompt Types:** Blending various prompt styles (e.g., few-shot, role-based, chain-of-thought) for complex tasks.
*   **Reasoning Scaffolds:** Guiding models through step-by-step reasoning processes.
*   **Role-Play Prompting:** Instructing LLMs to adopt specific personas.
*   **Automated Prompt Engineering:** Using LLMs to rewrite prompt instructions and add examples (e.g., DSPy).
*   **Tree of Thoughts (ToT):** An extension of chain-of-thought that explores intermediate thoughts in a tree structure.
*   **Multimodal Integration:** Combining text, images, audio, and video inputs in prompts.
*   **Dynamic Context Management:** Maintaining context across extended conversations and adapting to feedback.
*   **Automated Prompt Optimization / Meta Prompting:** Using machine learning or AI to generate and refine prompts for other AI systems.
*   **Context Engineering:** Strategically filling the context window with precise information (advocated by Andrej Karpathy).
*   **Layered Prompting:** Blending role framing, structured reasoning, and format constraints.
*   **Decomposition:** Breaking down complex tasks into smaller sub-problems for the model.

**Prompt Engineering Frameworks:**

*   **DSPy:** A framework for automating prompt engineering.
*   **LangChain:** Helps build LLM-powered applications by integrating LLMs with other data sources.
*   **PromptFlow:** A low-code tool for building LLM applications.
*   **POWER framework:** A systematic approach for effective prompt structure.
*   **PromptLayer:** For logging, tracking, and analyzing prompt performance.
*   **Promptmetheus:** An "Engineer's IDE" supporting meta-prompting workflows.
*   **Agenta:** An open-source LLMOps platform for fine-tuning and comparing LLM outputs.
*   **GPT Engineer:** Translates natural language descriptions into functional code.
*   **Haystack:** Specializes in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
*   Other notable tools include LlamaIndex, Guidance, AIPRM, PromptBase, PromptPerfect, and Mirascope.

**Leading Practitioners and Organizations:**

*   **Sander Schulhoff:** Known for early prompt engineering guides and HackAPrompt.
*   **Andrej Karpathy:** Prominent advocate for "context engineering."
*   **Lakera:** Provides guidance on building useful, reliable, and safe generative AI systems.
*   **Google AI / Google Research:** Contributed to Chain-of-Thought and Tree of Thoughts, and published best practices.
*   **OpenAI:** Involved in research and leads in generative AI with tools like GPT-Builder.
*   **Microsoft:** Contributes to prompt engineering studies and enhances its models using AI prompt engineering.
*   **Princeton and Stanford Universities:** Have contributed to comprehensive prompt engineering studies.
*   **Mike Taylor:** Co-author of "Prompt Engineering for Generative AI."
