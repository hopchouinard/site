# New-Topic Detector - 2025-11-16

Loaded cached credentials.
Based on trending discussions in the AI space and the existing research categories within the project, I propose the following three new research categories to be added to the daily loop:

1.  **Security & Risk**: This category would focus on cybersecurity threats, model vulnerabilities, adversarial attacks, and data privacy risks specific to AI systems. This is a critical and evolving area in AI.
2.  **Enterprise Adoption**: This category would track real-world case studies, implementation patterns, and ROI analyses of AI in large corporations. This provides a practical view of AI's impact and challenges in business environments.
3.  **Long-Term Forecast**: This category would synthesize long-range (5-10 year) technological predictions from reputable sources, focusing on potential paradigm shifts and foundational research that may not be immediately market-relevant but are crucial for strategic planning.
