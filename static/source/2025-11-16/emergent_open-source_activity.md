Here's a summary of new open-source AI frameworks, libraries, and datasets released this week (November 2025):

**Frameworks:**

*   **Meta AI's Omnilingual ASR:** A speech recognition suite supporting over 1,600 languages, including wav2vec 2.0 encoders, CTC ASR, LLM ASR, and a zero-shot LLM ASR model.
*   **Spring AI 1.1 GA:** Offers native support for AI models from various providers (Ollama, ZhipuAI, Anthropic, OpenAI), introduces Spring AI Agents for agentic coding tools, and Spring AI Bench for evaluation.
*   **Continue.dev:** An open-source, local-first AI coding assistant integrating with models like Ollama, Claude 3, or Gemini 2, focusing on privacy and customizable prompts.
*   **v0.dev by Vercel:** Generates React components from text prompts, with a recent update adding AI-powered design themes.
*   **LangGraph + CrewAI:** Frameworks for orchestrating multiple AI models into collaborative workflows, enabling AI agents to take on specific roles.
*   **Google Cloud's Agentic AI framework guideline:** A technical document setting standards for developing production-grade agentic AI systems, referencing an open-source Model Context Protocol server.
*   **Terminal-Bench 2.0 & Harbor:** An updated open-source benchmark for evaluating AI agents in a shell environment, and a container-based framework for reproducible agent evaluation.
*   **RAG-Anything:** A unified framework enhancing multimodal knowledge retrieval by integrating cross-modal relationships and semantic matching.
*   **Agent Lightning:** A flexible reinforcement learning framework for training LLMs in various agent roles.
*   **FilmAgent:** A multi-agent framework for end-to-end film automation in virtual 3D spaces.
*   **DeepAnalyze:** An agentic LLM that autonomously completes the data science pipeline from raw data to research reports.
*   **LightRAG:** Improves Retrieval-Augmented Generation by integrating graph structures for enhanced contextual awareness and efficient information retrieval.

**Libraries:**

*   **NVIDIA NeMo 2.0:** An open-source generative AI framework with recent updates supporting models like Llama 4, Flux, Llama Nemotron, Hyena & Evo2, Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Qwen3-30B&32B.
*   **Baidu's ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking:** An open-source multimodal AI model.
*   **Kimi K2 Thinking (Moonshot AI):** An open-source reasoning model.
*   **Baguettotron (pleias):** A small (321 million parameters) open-source reasoning SLM.
*   **gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b (OpenAI):** Two open-source large language models (released August 5, 2025).

**Datasets:**

*   **Encord's Multimodal Dataset (EMM1):** Described as the "world's largest open-source multimodal dataset," containing 1 billion data pairs and 100 million grouped data samples across text, images, audio, video, and 3D point clouds.
*   **Omnilingual ASR Corpus:** Part of Meta AI's Omnilingual ASR, includes 3,350 hours of speech data for 348 languages.
*   **Terminal-Bench 2.0:** An open-source benchmark dataset comprising 89 realistic terminal tasks for evaluating AI agents.
*   **Google Research Datasets:** Periodically releases open-source datasets, with recent examples including "Topics API DP Synthetic Data Release," "ScreenQA," and "CF-TriviaQA."
