# Visualization Prompt - 2025-11-09

Loaded cached credentials.
Okay, I will create an outline for an HTML dashboard section summarizing today's insights. I'll use `sequential_thinking` to break down the task.
Error executing tool sequential_thinking: Tool "sequential_thinking" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "sequentialthinking", "delete_entities", "search_file_content"?
My mistake, I used the wrong tool name. I'll correct it to `sequentialthinking` and continue.
