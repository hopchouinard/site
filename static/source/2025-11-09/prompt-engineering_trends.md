Here's a summary of new prompt-engineering techniques and frameworks:

**New Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Encourages LLMs to break down complex problems into intermediate steps, improving reasoning. Variations include Zero-Shot CoT and Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT).
*   **Meta Prompting:** Using LLMs to generate and refine prompts for other LLMs, focusing on structuring and guiding responses.
*   **Self-Consistency Prompting:** Generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer for reliability.
*   **Least-to-Most Prompting (LtM):** Decomposing complex problems into smaller, sequential sub-problems.
*   **Multi-Task Prompting:** Designing a single prompt to perform multiple interconnected tasks simultaneously.
*   **Role Prompting:** Assigning a specific persona to the LLM to guide its style and focus.
*   **Verbalized Sampling (VS):** Prompts the AI to generate multiple answers based on its internal probability distribution.
*   **Chain-of-Table:** For structured data reasoning, where the LLM manipulates table structures step-by-step.
*   **Adaptive Prompting:** LLMs adjust their response style based on user input and preferences.
*   **Logic-of-Thought (LoT) Prompting:** Designed for scenarios where logical reasoning is paramount.

**Prompt Engineering Frameworks:**

*   **CRISPE Framework:** (Capacity and Role, Request, Instructions, Steps, Persona, Examples) - Comprehensive for complex tasks.
*   **CRAFT Framework:** A structured and adaptable framework.
*   **RACE Framework:** (Role, Action, Context, Expectation) - Simple and efficient for customizable prompts.
*   **STAR Framework:** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) - Ideal for scenario-based prompting.
*   **RTF Framework:** (Role, Task, Format) - Simple yet powerful for quick, focused tasks.
*   **5W1H Framework:** (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) - For comprehensive information gathering.
*   **REACT Framework:** (Reason, Execute, Analyze, Critique, Try again) - Dynamic for iterative problem-solving.
*   **CLEAR Framework:** (Concise, Logical, Engaging, Actionable, Results-focused) - For professional communication.
*   **SPEAR Framework:** (Start, Provide, Explain, Ask, Rinse & Repeat) - A straightforward approach for clarity.
*   **RASCEF Framework:** (Role, Action, Steps, Context, Examples, Format) - Comprehensive for detailed guidance.
*   **APE Framework:** (Action, Purpose, Expectation)
*   **BAB Framework:** (Before, After, Bridge)
*   **TAG Framework:** (Task, Action, Goal)
*   **TRACE Framework:** (Task, Request, Action, Context, Example)
*   **CARE Framework:** (Context, Action, Result, Example)
*   **PAR Framework:** (Problem, Action, Result)

**Leading Practitioners:**

The field tends to highlight companies and methodologies rather than specific individuals. However, some techniques are attributed to researchers (e.g., Chain-of-Table by Wang et al., Chain-of-Thought by Wei et al., SPEAR Framework by Britney Muller). There are also companies specializing in AI prompt engineering services.
