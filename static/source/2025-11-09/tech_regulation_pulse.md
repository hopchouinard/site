There is no readily available information on newly enacted AI laws, bills, or policy statements from North America or the EU within the last 7 days.

However, ongoing discussions and anticipated regulations continue to highlight potential business impacts. For example, companies are expecting increased and substantial compliance costs due to existing and upcoming AI laws, such as the EU AI Act and various US state AI laws. Regulations related to automated decision-making, like those discussed by the California Privacy Protection Agency, could impose significant requirements on businesses utilizing technology and potentially lead to conflicts with privacy and security objectives. These trends suggest a continued focus on compliance and operational adjustments for businesses leveraging AI.
