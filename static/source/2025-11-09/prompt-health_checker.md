# Prompt-Health Checker - 2025-11-09

Loaded cached credentials.
I need to review daily prompts for redundancy or drift, then suggest rephrasing, merging, or retiring them. I'll begin by listing the contents of `data/prompts/` to find them.
An ignored item in `data/prompts/` means I need to see all files. I'll relist the directory, ignoring `.gitignore` and `.geminiignore` to reveal everything.
`data/prompts/` is empty except for `.gitkeep`, so daily prompts aren't there. The `site/src/content/dashboards/2025-11-09.md` is a dashboard, not a prompt. I'll search the `data/` directory for "prompt:", "template:", or "instruction:" to find prompt definitions.
No prompt keywords in `data/`. I'll broaden my search to all `.md` files in the project, looking for "prompt" or "instruction" to find prompt definitions.
I'll examine Markdown files for "daily prompt" content, focusing on `ai_docs/intents/`, `ai_docs/templates/`, and `docs/context-aware-prompts.md`. I'll search for "prompt" or "instruction" within these files to identify relevant daily prompt definitions.

<ctrl46>}I've found the "Daily AI Research & Ideation Prompt Set" in `ai_docs/intents/prompts.md`, confirming it's my source for daily prompts. `docs/context-aware-prompts.md` details prompt execution and context injection. My next step is to extract, categorize, and analyze these prompts for redundancy or drift, then suggest rephrasing, merging, or retiring them. I'll begin by re-reading and parsing `ai_docs/intents/prompts.md`.
I've extracted and categorized the daily prompts from `ai_docs/intents/prompts.md`. My analysis reveals some redundancy between "AI Ecosystem Watch" and "Emergent Open-Source Activity," which I propose merging. I also suggest rephrasing "Startup Radar" to clarify its focus and avoid overlap with "Corporate Strategy Roundup." The "Ideation Loop," "Creative & Analytical Reformatting," and "Meta-Maintenance & Evolution" categories appear well-defined and require no changes. These adjustments will streamline the daily prompt execution. I'll now format these suggestions.
