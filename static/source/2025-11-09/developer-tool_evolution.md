Here's a summary of new features and releases for GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Cursor:

**GitHub Copilot:**
*   **Agent Mode and Autonomous Capabilities:** Copilot can now operate more autonomously, converting prompts into code, executing terminal commands, running tools, and fixing errors. It can also be assigned GitHub issues to make code changes and create pull requests.
*   **Copilot CLI:** Interact with Copilot directly from the terminal for tasks like asking questions, modifying local files, and performing GitHub actions.
*   **Multi-model AI Access:** Supports various LLMs including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet, and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash.
*   **Enhanced Code Review:** A dedicated agent assists in analyzing pull requests, identifying issues, and suggesting improvements.
*   **Smarter Chat and Contextual Understanding:** Improved chat capabilities, Bing-powered web search integration, and personalized chat responses with custom instructions.
*   **Vision Feature:** Processes images and screenshots to understand user intentions for UI changes.
*   **Function Calling:** Enhanced ability to provide precise recommendations by automatically determining relevant context and tools.
*   **Editor and Workflow Improvements:** "Copilot Edits" for multi-file changes, inline chat, improved commit suggestions, new project generation with `@workspace`, terminal error explanations, and inline terminal chat.
*   **Performance Enhancements:** Faster and more accurate code retrieval.
*   **Code Referencing (Preview):** Helps find and review relevant open-source licenses.
