I need to clarify the correct path for "today's research" files. The prompt states they are in `data/outputs/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/`, but the provided folder structure shows research files under `site/static/source/YYYY-MM-DD/`, with the latest date being `2025-11-12`.

Could you please confirm which directory contains the research files I should analyze for today, November 13, 2025? If the `data/outputs/daily/2025-11-13/` directory is the correct one, I will proceed with that. If not, please specify the correct path.
