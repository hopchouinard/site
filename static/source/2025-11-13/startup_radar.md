Here's a summary of emerging startups and open-source communities developing notable AI applications, particularly agentic frameworks:

**Open-Source AI Agentic Frameworks:**

*   **LangChain:** A widely adopted framework for building LLM-powered applications, offering a modular architecture for components like chains, memory, agents, and tools.
*   **AutoGen (Microsoft):** Focuses on autonomous, asynchronous agent collaboration, allowing agents to work together flexibly.
*   **CrewAI:** A high-abstraction framework designed for quickly building agent systems with structured roles and task delegation, specializing in multi-agent collaboration.
*   **LangGraph:** Builds on LangChain, offering a graph-based approach for modeling multi-agent workflows and providing stricter engineering control.
*   **Microsoft Agent Framework:** An open-source SDK and runtime that unifies Semantic Kernel with AutoGen for production-ready multi-agent systems.
*   **Semantic Kernel (Microsoft):** Designed for enterprise use, connecting LLMs with real-world tools, data sources, and APIs.
*   **Auto-GPT & BabyAGI:** Known for autonomous task execution and management.
*   **SmolAgents & MetaGPT:** Offer lightweight experimentation and simulations of software development teams, respectively.
*   **SuperAGI:** Provides a full-stack agent infrastructure with a focus on extensibility and a graphical interface.
*   **Open Agents (formerly OpenDevin):** Designed for building and debugging code through natural language instructions within an AI-enhanced development environment.
*   **kagent:** An open-source framework for DevOps and platform engineers to run AI agents in Kubernetes.
*   **Atomic Agents:** An emerging open-source framework for decentralized, multi-agent systems.

**Emerging AI Startups Utilizing Agentic Frameworks:**

*   **Adept AI:** Focuses on creating agentic AI that interacts seamlessly with computer interfaces to automate complex office tasks.
*   **Aegis:** Develops autonomous insurance claim appeal agents.
*   **Approval AI:** Specializes in mortgage approval agents.
*   **Galen AI:** Provides intelligent healthcare agents.
*   **Hyperbots:** Offers intelligent agents for automating bookkeeping and finance tasks.
*   **Qodo:** Is developing autonomous code debugging agents that can write, edit, and test code.
*   **Devin:** Aims to create a 100% autonomous software engineer.
