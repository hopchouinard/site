# Prompt-Health Checker - 2025-11-13

Loaded cached credentials.
I need to analyze the daily prompts for redundancy or drift. First, I'll locate the daily prompt files, likely under `site/static/source/YYYY-MM-DD/`, then read their content, and finally, analyze them to suggest improvements.

I'll begin by listing the directories in `site/static/source/` to find the latest daily prompts.
The daily prompts are dated. I'll examine the most recent set from `2025-11-12` by reading all files in that directory to understand the current prompts.

I've analyzed all 21 daily prompts from `2025-11-12` for redundancy or drift. Each prompt, despite some minor input overlaps, provides a unique analytical lens or output crucial to the NeuroHelix research and ideation pipeline.

**Conclusion:** All current daily prompts are well-optimized and serve distinct purposes. I recommend **keeping all prompts as they are**, with no rephrasing, merging, or retiring necessary at this time.
