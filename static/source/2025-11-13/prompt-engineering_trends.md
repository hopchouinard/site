# Prompt-Engineering Trends - 2025-11-13

Loaded cached credentials.
Here's a summary of new prompt-engineering techniques and frameworks, along with leading practitioners, as of late 2024 and 2025:

**New Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

*   **Context Engineering:** Optimizing the entire context window for the AI model, not just the instruction text.
*   **Multimodal Integration:** Combining text with images, audio, and video inputs in prompts.
*   **Dynamic Context Management:** Systems that maintain context across extended conversations and adapt based on feedback.
*   **Automated Prompt Optimization:** Using machine learning to improve prompts themselves.
*   **Agentic AI Prompting:** Generative AI autonomously undertaking end-to-end tasks.
*   **Logic-of-Thought (LoT) Prompting:** Guiding AI to process problems logically, derive solutions, and explain them.
*   **Conversational-Amplified Prompt Engineering (CAPE):** Engaging in back-and-forth conversation with AI to refine prompt intentions.
*   **Chain-of-Density (CoD) and Chain-of-Feedback (CoF) Prompting:** Variations of Chain-of-Thought, with CoF aiming to reduce AI hallucinations.
*   **Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting (RSIP):** AI critiquing and improving its own output.
*   **Combining Prompt Types:** Blending various styles (few-shot, role-based, formatting, chain-of-thought) for complex tasks.
*   **Prompt Compression:** Reducing prompt length while retaining effectiveness to minimize costs and latency.
*   **Anchored Prompts:** Using predefined sections to guide model structure and focus.
*   **AI-Generated Prompt Improvement:** AI models suggesting improvements to existing prompts.
*   **Structured Output:** Forcing AI outputs into specific formats like JSON or XML.
*   **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing diverse, high-quality examples to guide AI behavior.
*   **Self-Criticism:** Encouraging LLMs to check, critique, and improve their own responses.

**Prompt Engineering Frameworks:**

*   **TCRTE Framework:** Focuses on Task clarity, Context, References, Testing criteria, and Enhancement strategies for AI-generated prompt improvement.
*   **APE, PECRA, OSCAR, and TAG:** Advanced frameworks for precise communication with AI models.
*   **LangChain:** An open-source framework for building language model-powered applications by chaining multiple prompts.
*   **General Framework Components:** Typically include defining context, objective, style, tone, constraints, output format, role assignment, and context injection.

**Leading Practitioners:**

*   **Andrej Karpathy:** Advocates for "context engineering."
*   **Sander Schulhoff:** Recognized as an "OG prompt engineer," developed the internet's first prompt engineering guide, and co-authored a comprehensive study on prompt engineering.
